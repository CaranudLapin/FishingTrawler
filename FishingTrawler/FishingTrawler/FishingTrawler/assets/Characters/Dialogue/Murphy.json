  "Greeting": "Ahoy there {0}!$h#$b#The sea be in our favor today. With Yoba's Blessing we'll make it back in one piece.$n#$e",
  "Greeting_Rainy": "Ahoy there {0}!$h#$b#The sea be rough today aye, but a couple of seadogs like us will manage.$n#$e",
  "Options": "Fancy a fishing trip, {0}?",
  "Confirm_First_Trip": "Since this will be yer first trip, would ye like an explanation of a deckhand's duties?",
  "Minigame_Explanation_Hull": "Yer main job as deckhand will be to keep the Dawnshard afloat while we sail around the Fern Islands.$n#$b#The ol' girl has seen better days, much like myself, and she's prone to breaking dow.$s#$b#Holes are likely to appear in the hull, so be sure to patch 'em up quickly.$n#$b#If we take on too much water, I'll have to turn us around and yer share of the haul will become a pittance.$s#$b#",
  "Minigame_Explanation_Bailing": "I'll provide ye with a bailin' bucket when we weigh anchor. Use it in the hull to scoop up some water and empty it into the sea to reduce the flooding.$n#$b#",
  "Minigame_Explanation_Nets": "Yer second duty is to make sure the nets stay in workin' order. They are located on the deck, held by the cranes near the stern.$n#$b#No working nets means no fish for us.$s#$b#",
  "Minigame_Explanation_Engine": "Lastly is the engine, located in the cabin. The pipes leak steam occasionally and will need to be patched up.$n#$b#A leaking pipe means a failin' engine. A failin' engine means the nets won't catch as many fish. If both the nets and engine fail, we start losin' fish too.$s#$b#",
  "Minigame_Explanation_Finish": "The full share of the haul be yers if we make it back in one piece. Otherwise, if we turn back early, yer share will be smaller fraction.$n#$b#If yer up for the job, let me know and we'll see about headin' out.$h#$e#",

  "After_Trip_Successful": "Well done {0}! We'll make a true seadog out of ye.$h#$b#Yer share of the haul is stored in crate to the left!$n#$e",
  "After_Trip_Failure": "By Yoba's Blessing we made it back in one piece.$s#$b#Don't worry {0}, there is always next time.$n#$e",
  "Trip_Finished": "Yer itchin' to go on another expedition?$n#$b#Sorry {0}, ye will have to wait til next week. These ol' bones need some rest.$h#$e",
